# Sub3 Contracts - Decentralized Subscription Management Platform

[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](README.md)

A decentralized subscription management system built on Ethereum, featuring multi-tier subscription plans, referral rewards mechanism, and factory pattern deployment.

## üìã Overview

Sub3 Contracts is a comprehensive blockchain subscription service solution that allows creators and businesses to deploy their own subscription services through factory contracts, supporting custom branding, pricing strategies, and referral systems. The system is particularly suitable for DApps, content creators, and SaaS services that require subscription-based monetization.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **üè≠ Factory Pattern Deployment**: Deploy multiple independent subscription projects through a single factory contract
- **üìä Four-Tier Subscription System**: Support for Starter, Standard, Pro, and Max subscription tiers
- **‚è±Ô∏è Flexible Billing Periods**: Support for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly billing modes
- **üí∞ Referral Reward System**: Referrers earn 10% commission, referred users get 10% cashback
- **üé® Brand Customization**: Each project has independent brand identity (name, symbol, logo, theme color)
- **‚ö° Gas Optimization**: Efficient deployment using Solady library and clone pattern
- **üìà Data Analytics**: Comprehensive revenue and user data tracking
- **üîí Security Mechanisms**: Multiple security measures including reentrancy protection, access control, and payment validation
- **üåê Web3 UI**: Complete frontend interface with MetaMask and other wallet support

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Contracts

#### Factory.sol
Responsible for deploying new subscription projects using clone pattern for efficient gas usage.

**Main Functions:**
- `deployNewProject()`: Deploy new subscription project with custom brand configuration
- `setPlatformFeeBasisPoints()`: Set platform fee rate (in basis points)
- `withdrawFees()`: Withdraw accumulated platform fees
- `getProjectsPaginated()`: Query deployed projects with pagination
- `getRevenueStats()`: Get platform revenue statistics

**Revenue Sources:**
- Project creation fee: 0.01 ETH (default)
- Platform commission: 5% of subscription revenue (default, max 30%)
- Direct deposits: Support for ETH donations

#### Project.sol
Manages subscriptions and reward system for individual subscription projects.

**Subscription Management:**
- `subscribe()`: First-time subscription with optional referrer
- `renew()`: Renew expired subscription
- `upgrade()`: Upgrade to higher tier (pro-rated)
- `downgrade()`: Downgrade to lower tier (only after expiry)
- `extend()`: Extend current subscription period

**Admin Functions:**
- `setPlanConfig()`: Update tier pricing and feature configuration
- `updateBrandConfig()`: Modify brand settings (except name and symbol)
- `withdraw()`: Withdraw contract balance (excluding pending rewards)
- `emergencyPause()`: Emergency pause functionality

**Referral System:**
- Referrers earn 10% commission on subscription fees
- Referred users get 10% instant cashback
- 7-day cooldown period for reward claims
- Referrer must have active subscription to be valid

#### ProjectReaderImpl.sol
Provides efficient data query functionality shared across all projects.

**Query Functions:**
- Get user subscription status and history
- Batch query subscriber information
- Get referral relationships and reward data
- Statistical data aggregation

### Supporting Contracts

#### DataTypes.sol
Defines all data structures used in the system:
- `BrandConfig`: Project brand configuration
- `SubscriptionPlan`: Tier configuration and pricing
- `UserSubscription`: User subscription details
- `ReferralAccount`: Referral tracking and rewards
- `OperationRecord`: Operation history records

#### ProjectStorage.sol
Storage layout for Project contracts, inheriting from Ownable.

### Interface Definitions

- **IFactory.sol**: Factory contract interface
- **IProject.sol**: Complete project contract interface
- **IProjectRead.sol**: Read-only query interface
- **IProjectWrite.sol**: State modification interface

## üíé Subscription Tiers

The system supports four subscription tiers, each configurable with different prices and features:

### Starter Tier
- **Daily**: Project-defined pricing
- **Weekly**: Project-defined pricing
- **Monthly**: Project-defined pricing
- **Yearly**: Project-defined pricing (usually discounted)
- **Features**: Basic feature set

### Standard Tier
- **Daily**: Project-defined pricing
- **Weekly**: Project-defined pricing
- **Monthly**: Project-defined pricing
- **Yearly**: Project-defined pricing (usually discounted)
- **Features**: Standard feature set

### Pro Tier
- **Daily**: Project-defined pricing
- **Weekly**: Project-defined pricing
- **Monthly**: 0.01 ETH (example price)
- **Yearly**: 0.1 ETH (~17% discount)
- **Features**: Advanced feature set

### Max Tier
- **Daily**: Project-defined pricing
- **Weekly**: Project-defined pricing
- **Monthly**: 0.03 ETH (example price)
- **Yearly**: 0.3 ETH (~17% discount)
- **Features**: All features unlocked

## üéÅ Referral Rewards Mechanism

The referral system promotes user growth through mutual incentives:

### Referrer Benefits
- **Commission Rate**: 10% of referred subscription fees
- **Eligibility**: Must have active subscription
- **Reward Accumulation**: Rewards automatically accumulate to pending balance
- **Claim Restrictions**: Can claim accumulated rewards every 7 days
- **Tracking**: Records number of referrals and total earnings

### Referred User Benefits
- **Instant Cashback**: 10% cashback on subscription
- **Automatic Distribution**: Cashback sent directly to wallet
- **No Waiting**: No need to wait or manually claim
- **Stackable Benefits**: Can be combined with other promotions

### Validation Rules
- ‚úÖ Referrer must have active subscription
- ‚ùå Self-referral not allowed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid referrers are silently ignored (no transaction failure)
- üìä All referral relationships are on-chain verifiable

## üí∏ Revenue Flow

Fund allocation flow for subscription payments:

```
Subscription Payment (100%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Platform Fee (5%) ‚Üí Factory Contract
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Referrer Reward (10%) ‚Üí Referrer's Pending Balance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Subscriber Cashback (10%) ‚Üí Subscriber (instant)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Net Revenue (75%) ‚Üí Project Contract
```

### Fund Flow Explanation

1. **User Payment**: User pays full subscription fee
2. **Platform Commission**: 5% automatically transferred to factory contract
3. **Referral Reward**: If referrer exists, 10% credited to referrer account
4. **User Cashback**: If referral code used, 10% immediately returned to user
5. **Project Revenue**: Remaining funds belong to project owner
